The Allegany High School robotics team has had several successful seasons
competing in First Tech Challenge.
FTC rquires students to design and build a remotely operated robot
that typically has to move odd shaped objects to some location
on a playing field to score points.
There is also a two minute autonmous period where the
robot must guide and operate itself to achieve
some goal to score points.
The photo shows students working on a robot that needed to
lift cones up and drop them on the yellow poles.

<p>
The Allegany High School has a dedicated robotics lab
with robotic components and tools to construct robots.
Current projects include:
<ul>
  <li> small (14") robotic arms using
  <li> IR controlled tank
  <li> autonomously controlled obstacle avoidance 6-wheeled rover
  <li> a GoBilda robot with rotating telescopic arm on a 4-wheel platform
  <li> elevator
</ul>

Robotics is just one aspect of industrial automation,
not all robots have wheels,
that students are exposed to.
Students are learning aspects of:
<ul>
  <li> mechanical design, including CAD and 3d-printing,
  <li> of DC motors, gearing and servos,
  <li> optical and ultra-sonic sensors and
  <li> programming using small processors such as Arduino
</ul>
